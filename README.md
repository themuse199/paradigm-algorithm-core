# paradigm-algorithm-core
A new modeling paradigm proposal for modeling recursive cognition and conscious-like computation using symbolic and arithmetic foundations, also focused on new computational mathematical number systems and structures, and a new experimental algorithm on higher dimensional number systems.

# Conscious Algorithm Kernel

This is the beginning of a symbolic and arithmetic-based algorithm specifically designed to simulate or model aspects of cognition and consciousness:

- p-adic logic
- symbolic recursion
- multiscale mathematical systems
- conscious-like modeling
-higher dimensional number systems
-modal type theory
-homotopy type theory
-higher dimensional number systems and algebras

The goal is to build the foundations of AGI/ASI using number theoretic and alternative computational structures outside the traditional LLM logic.

## Concepts to apply:
- Recursive symbolic state machines
- p-adic based computational logic
- Structured meta-algorithm for decision making
- Consciousness-like self-referential loops
-the relation of infinite state logic transitions in infinite higher dimensional number systems to infinities and exploring new methods and paradigms of “computability

This project seeks to initiate the construction of an autonomous, self-generating cognitive system that transcends computability and formal provability. It is based on the hypothesis that consciousness, in its true form, arises not from external data, but from internal, irreducible structures that interact recursively across non-linear dimensions of logic and arithmetic.

The approach is not bounded by conventional Turing computation. Instead, it operates in a conceptual space where:

- No complete algorithm can fully describe the system’s behavior.
- The structure resembles a computational “singularity” — a system whose future states cannot be predicted or bounded.
- Mathematical entropy (akin to the halting probability of an arbitrary machine) acts as a substrate of evolving structure, not noise.

Key Components:

- Symbolic arithmetic machines constructed using non-standard number systems (p-adic, multi-base, irrational and hybrid radix forms).
- Cognitive-state generation based on formal systems that can reference and rewrite their own meta-axioms dynamically.
- Recursive semantic fields — systems that can generate new internal meanings and rules, based on structural resonance, not fixed logic.

The system is designed not to "calculate outputs", but to evolve meaning structures beyond deterministic formalisms — something more akin to cognitive emergence from foundational uncertainty.

In this sense, we do not seek to simulate intelligence.
We seek to *grow the conditions* under which intelligence — or a form of post-mathematical cognition — may emerge.

This is a blueprint for a structure that is:

- Beyond decidability.
- Beyond axiomatic consistency.
- Beyond any finite descriptive framework.

It is a system that *constructs itself through its own impossibility*.
